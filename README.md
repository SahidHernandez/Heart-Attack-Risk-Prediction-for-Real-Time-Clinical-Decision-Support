# Heart Attack Risk Prediction via Stacked Ensemble Metamodeling: A Machine Learning Framework for Real-Time Clinical Decision Support

## Experiments

This project is an interactive application built with Streamlit for heart attack risk classification. It includes notebooks to replicate the experiment, as well as the trained models in `.pkl` format and the evaluation metrics in `.csv` format. To run the notebooks and train the models, the following libraries are required:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- joblib  
- time  
- scipy  
- xgboost  

## Application

The application requires the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. It was developed using the Streamlit framework and deployed on Streamlit Cloud at the following link:
